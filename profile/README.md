# go-nv

👋 Hi, folks!

🚀 What was previously known as https://github.com/syndbg/goenv is now part of an organization where maintainers can be added more easily and collaboration can happen organically.

👥 The organization aims to unify the distribution of goenv, be that to package managers such as homebrew and others, while also exploring other opportunities to further improve `goenv` with multiple repositories and/or extraction of functionality to separate repositories, if needed.

🎅 While goenv was created during a slow Christmas season in 2016, it grew into something that I'd never imagine would be that much useful to the Golang community.

🙏 I am grateful to the community and especially @ChronosMasterOfAllTime for dedicating the time to maintain the project and continue to further develop it.

Yours, Anton (@syndbg) 😊
